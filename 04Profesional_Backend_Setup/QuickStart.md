# Professional backend Setup:

1. We commence our project by creating a use model for it. Refer to picture one for a visual representation.

![Sample Image](./img1.png)

2. In the model, we observe that we handle images as part of our project.

3. During this phase, we establish our file and folder structure.

4. Initially, we initialize an empty Node application.

5. In our model, we also deal with images. It's crucial to note that when storing images, we utilize third-party services such as Microsoft Azure, Amazon AWS, and Cloudinary.

6. We narrow our focus when uploading photos or other media from users. We ensure that we store this media on our server to mitigate the impact in case of a sub-connection loss. This guarantees the presence of media on our server.

7. In the third process, we upload the photos to the third-party platform.

8. Some companies opt for a directed upload approach, while others use third-party packs. This choice depends on the specific practices of each company.

9. The concept of GitHub keep files is significant in our project.

10. Additionally, we consider the concept of GitHub ignore files.

11. Create a `.env` file.

12. Inside the project's root directory, create a `public` folder.

13. Within the `public` folder, create a `temp` folder.

14. Place the `.gitkeep` file inside the `temp` folder, allowing it to be pushed to GitHub without having extra files we make files in future initially we upload empty folder.

15. Create a `src` folder within the project's root directory.

16. Inside the `src` folder, create three files `app,js` `constants.js` `index.js`.

17. Address the issue of the server restarting repeatedly by exploring different options.

18. Install the `nodemon` dev dependency to handle server reloading upon changes.

19. Use the dev dependency installation process: insert a '-D' between `npm` and the package name, specifying it as a dev dependency.

20. Reload the server automatically when changes are made in the source files.

21. To achieve this, write a script for `nodemon` to execute.

22. Formulate the command for the script.

```js
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "nodemon src/index.js"
  },
```
21. Create additional folders within our source folder.

22. Utilize the following folders accordingly:

    - Controllers: Implement the majority of the application's functionality here.

    - Database: Write the connection logic for the database.

    - Middlewares: Implement middleware functions here.

    - Models: Handle data modeling in this folder.

    - Routes: Manage routes in this folder.

    - Utils: Store utility functions in this folder.

23. Install Prettier plugins so that we can work professionally in a team.

Developers use Prettier and its plugins to ensure a consistent and maintainable codebase, improve collaboration, and save time on manual code formatting. It has become a valuable tool in modern development workflows.

`.prettierrc`
The .prettierrc file is a configuration file used by the Prettier code formatter. It allows you to customize various formatting options to match the coding style preferences of your project. This file typically resides in the root directory of your project.

`.prettierignore`
The .prettierignore file is used to specify files and directories that should be excluded from Prettier formatting. It works similarly to the commonly used .gitignore file but is specific to Prettier.

```js
{
  "singleQuote": false,
  "bracketSpacing": true,
  "tabWidth": 2,
  "trailingComma": "es5",
  "semi": true
}
```


# How to connect database in MERN :

## Here we learnt about database connection:

Here, we're looking at different ways to connect to a database and how we deal with problems that may come up. 

We're using MongoDB as our database, specifically MongoDB Atlas, which is a cloud-based service provided by MongoDB. Just to be clear, we're not using a big, complicated database – we're going for MongoDB Atlas.


**What is MongoDB Atlas?**

MongoDB Atlas is like a super convenient and reliable home for your MongoDB databases. Imagine you have a bunch of information (like names, addresses, and other details) that you want to organize and store. MongoDB is a type of database that helps you do that. Now, MongoDB Atlas is a service that takes care of the tricky parts of managing that database, making it easier and more reliable.

**Key Points:**

1. **Cloud Hosting:** MongoDB Atlas lives on the internet (in the cloud). It's not a physical thing you have to set up in your office. This is great because it means your database can be accessed from anywhere, and you don't have to worry about maintaining hardware.

2. **Easy Setup:** Setting up a MongoDB database can be a bit technical, but with MongoDB Atlas, it's much simpler. You choose your preferences like how much storage you need, where you want it to be located (like in the US or Europe), and other settings.

3. **Automatic Updates:** Imagine your database is like a smartphone. You want it to have the latest features and be secure. MongoDB Atlas takes care of updating and fixing things in the background, so you don't have to worry about it.

4. **Backups and Security:** Atlas automatically keeps copies of your database in case something goes wrong. It also has security features to make sure only the right people can access your information.

5. **Scaling Made Easy:** If your business grows and you need more space or power for your database, Atlas can easily scale up to handle more data and traffic without causing you headaches.

6. **Monitoring and Alerts:** Atlas keeps an eye on your database's health. If something looks odd or there's a problem, it can send you a message (alert) so you can fix it before it becomes a big issue.

In simple terms, MongoDB Atlas is like having a reliable caretaker for your MongoDB database. It lives in the cloud, makes sure things run smoothly, and takes care of technical stuff so you can focus on using your data rather than worrying about managing the database.

### Create a Project in MongoDB Atlas

Certainly, let's relate the process of creating a project in MongoDB Atlas to familiar concepts:

1. **Create a Project:**
   - Think of creating a project in MongoDB Atlas like setting up a special workspace or folder on your computer. It's a place where you'll organize and manage all the data related to a specific task or goal.

2. **Name Your Project:**
   - Giving a name to your project is similar to naming a folder on your computer. It helps you quickly identify and remember what's inside.

3. **Add Members:**
   - Adding members means inviting other people (like teammates or collaborators) to join your project. In computer terms, it's like sharing access to a shared folder with specific people.

4. **Project Names Have to be Unique:**
   - Imagine if you had two folders with the same name on your computer – it would be confusing. MongoDB Atlas ensures that each project name is unique within your organization, just like each folder having a unique name on your computer.

In MongoDB Atlas, a project is a way to organize and manage databases, collections, and related resources. Creating a project is like creating a virtual space to neatly arrange and handle data for a specific purpose. It's part of the process that helps you structure and manage your database-related tasks efficiently.

### Deploy your database:

When you go to the "Deploy" section in MongoDB Atlas, it means you are entering a part of the platform where you can set up and configure the deployment of your MongoDB database. Let's break down what this typically involves:

1. **Cloud Provider and Region:**
   - Choose the cloud provider (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP) where you want to host your MongoDB database.
   - Select the specific region or data center location within the chosen cloud provider's infrastructure. This impacts the physical location of your database servers.

2. **Cluster Configuration (Cluster Tier):**
   - Specify the type and size of your MongoDB cluster. This includes details such as the number of nodes, the type of storage, and the amount of RAM allocated to your cluster.

3. **Cluster Name:**
   - Give your MongoDB cluster a name for easy identification.

4. **Additional Settings:**
   - Depending on the cloud provider, you may have additional settings to configure, such as enabling backups, specifying the MongoDB version, or other provider-specific options.

5. **Cluster Connectivity:**
   - Configure network settings, such as IP whitelisting, to control which devices or services can access your MongoDB cluster. This is an essential security measure.

6. **Authentication and Authorization:**
   - Set up authentication mechanisms (e.g., username and password) to control who has access to your MongoDB cluster. You can also configure roles and permissions for more fine-grained access control.

7. **Cluster Tier and Disk Configuration:**
   - Depending on the chosen cluster tier, you may need to configure disk options, such as storage capacity and the type of storage (e.g., SSD).

8. **Review Configuration:**
   - Before deploying, review all the settings to ensure they align with your requirements and preferences.

9. **Deploy Cluster:**
   - Once you've configured everything, you can initiate the deployment process. MongoDB Atlas will then provision the necessary resources and set up your MongoDB cluster based on your specified configuration.

In essence, the "Deploy" section in MongoDB Atlas guides you through the process of specifying where and how you want your MongoDB database to be hosted. It covers various settings related to infrastructure, security, and performance to tailor the deployment according to your application's needs.

### Network Access Section:

Certainly! The "Network Access" section in MongoDB Atlas is like the bouncer at a club who decides who gets to come in. It's where you set the rules for who can connect to your MongoDB database.

Here's a breakdown in easy language:

1. **Access List Entry:**
   - This is like the VIP list. You specify which IP addresses or ranges are allowed to connect to your MongoDB database.
   - In the example you provided, `49.37.66.88/32` is on the list. It's a specific address or device that's allowed to access your MongoDB. Think of it like having a special invitation.

2. **Comment:**
   - This is like a little note to remind you why a certain IP address is on the list. In this case, it says it was created during the Auto Setup process, so you know it's there for a reason.

3. **ALLOW ACCESS FROM ANYWHERE:**
   - This is like saying, "Okay, everyone is invited!" It means any device or computer from anywhere can connect to your MongoDB database. While convenient, it's generally considered less secure because it opens the door to anyone.


In simpler terms, the "Network Access" section lets you decide who gets the keys to your MongoDB party. You can be specific and invite only certain IP addresses, or you can be more open and allow access from anywhere. It's a security feature that helps control who can interact with your MongoDB database.


### DataBase Access Section:

Absolutely, let's break down the "Database Access" section in MongoDB Atlas using simple language:

1. **Edit User: moazshamim1575@admin:**
   - Think of this like having a special key for a specific person named "moazshamim1575" who is the admin, meaning they have some powerful access rights.

2. **Authentication Method:**
   - This is the way MongoDB checks if the person trying to access the database is who they say they are. It's like choosing between a password, a certificate (a special kind of ID card), or other methods.

   - In this case, the authentication method chosen is "Password," so "moazshamim1575" needs to enter the correct password to get in.

3. **Database User Privileges:**
   - Imagine the user "moazshamim1575" as a guest at a party. The privileges are like the different things they can do at the party.

   - **Built-in Role:**
     - It's like giving "moazshamim1575" a specific role or job at the party. In this case, one role has been selected, maybe something like being the person who can look at and read things (SELECT).

   - **Custom Roles:**
     - These are special roles you can create yourself. It's like making up specific tasks or responsibilities for "moazshamim1575" at the party.

   - **Specific Privileges:**
     - This is like giving "moazshamim1575" certain special abilities or permissions. For example, they might be allowed to do specific things with certain parts of the party (database and collection). You can be very detailed about what they can and cannot do.

4. **Restrict Access to Specific Clusters:**
   - Imagine you're hosting multiple parties in different rooms. This option lets you decide which rooms "moazshamim1575" is allowed to enter.

   - By default, "moazshamim1575" can access everything in this project (the whole party), but you can enable this option to be more specific about where they can go.


In simpler terms, the "Database Access" section is where you decide who gets special access keys, how they prove they're allowed in, and what specific things they can do at the "party" (or database). It's like setting up security and permissions for different users.


### "Clusters" in MongoDB:

**Imagine a City of Databases:**
- Think of a "cluster" as a big city made up of many individual databases.
- Each database is like a separate house in the city, and all these houses together make up the entire cluster.

**City Infrastructure:**
- Just like a city has infrastructure (roads, electricity, water supply), a MongoDB cluster has its own infrastructure that helps databases communicate and work together.

**Roles in the City:**
- In the city, you have different roles like firefighters, police officers, and chefs. In a MongoDB cluster, you have different types of servers or nodes, each with its own role to play.

**Living Together:**
- All the databases in a cluster live together in harmony, just like people in a city. They share resources, help each other out, and make the entire city (or cluster) run smoothly.

**Why Clusters Are Useful:**
- Clusters provide a way to organize and manage lots of information. They ensure that even if one house (or database) has a problem, the rest of the city (or cluster) can still function well.

**Scaling Up:**
- If the city needs to grow, it can add more houses or buildings. Similarly, if your data grows, you can add more databases to your MongoDB cluster.

**Security and Access:**
- Just like cities have gates and guards for security, MongoDB clusters have measures to control who can access and interact with the databases.

**In Simple Terms:**
- A MongoDB cluster is like a busy and well-organized city where databases live, work together, and share resources to make sure everything runs smoothly. Each database is a part of the city, contributing to the overall functioning of the cluster.

### Connect to Cluster :

let's simplify the process of connecting to Cluster in MongoDB Atlas:

1. **Connect to Cluster:**
   - Think of "Cluster0" as a special place where your MongoDB databases live. Connecting to it is like getting the keys to the entrance.

2. **Set Up Connection Security:**
   - Just like having locks on your doors to keep things safe, setting up connection security is about making sure only the right people (or applications) can access your MongoDB data.

3. **Choose a Connection Method:**
   - Imagine you have different ways to enter a building – maybe through the front door, a side entrance, or even a secret passage. Choosing a connection method is like picking how you want to access your MongoDB data.

4. **Connect:**
   - Now, you're ready to actually open the door and go inside (connect). There are different tools or methods you can use:

   - **Access your Atlas data using MongoDB’s native drivers:**
     - This is like using a special key (driver) that MongoDB understands. It's a way for your software (like Node.js or Go) to talk to the MongoDB database.

   - **Access your data through tools:**
     - This is like using a magic tool to see and work with your data. You can choose from different tools based on what you're comfortable with or what suits your needs.

   - **Data Explorer, Compass, Shell, MongoDB for VS Code, Atlas SQL:**
     - These are like different doors or entrances you can use to interact with your MongoDB data. Each one has its own features, like a Data Explorer for browsing, Compass for visualizing data, Shell for quick commands, VS Code for developers, and Atlas SQL for connecting with SQL tools.

   - **Go Back and Close:**
     - If you change your mind or finish what you were doing, you can go back or close the connection, just like leaving a building and locking the door behind you.

In simple terms, connecting to Cluster is like entering a secure place where your MongoDB data is stored. You can choose how you want to get in, use different tools to explore and work with your data, and when you're done, you can leave or close the connection.

### Connecting with MongoDB Compass:

When you click Connecting with MongoDB Compass , MongoDB Atlas provide you a connection string from which you connect to your Clusters(DataBase)

The connection string you see is like a secret code that helps your computer talk to the MongoDB database in the cloud (Cluster0). Let's break it down:

1. `mongodb+srv://`: This is just a way of saying, "Hey, I want to connect to a MongoDB server!"

2. `moazshamim1575`: This is the username you'll use to log in.

3. `<password>`: You need to replace this with the actual password for the user 'moazshamim1575'.

4. `@cluster0.gwa9zwr.mongodb.net/`: This is the address of the MongoDB server. It's like telling your computer where to find the database. In this case, it's Cluster0 in the MongoDB cloud.

So, when you put it all together, it's like telling your computer, "Connect to MongoDB using the username 'moazshamim1575', with this password, and find the database in Cluster0 in the MongoDB cloud."

Make sure to replace `<password>` with the real password, and then you can use this code to connect your computer to the MongoDB database!

You can use this connection string in the env file of your project to connect your project from DataBase. 



## Now, let's delve into our codebase and learn how we connect to the database.

First, navigate to the environment variable file env and include all the necessary variables such as PORT, DB_URI, and others.

Next, define the database name in a constants file and export it. Placing it in the constants file allows for easy modification in the future. If the file name needs to be changed later, this modification can be done in one place, affecting every instance where this database name is used.
 
### database connection approach:

There are two major ways of connecting to a database in Node.js:

1. **Single File Approach:**
   In this method, all the code and functionality are defined in the index file. The index file is typically the first one executed through nodemon.

2. **Modular Approach:**
   Here, a dedicated database folder is created, and all connection logic and functions are defined in a separate file within that folder. Afterward, this function is imported into the index file and executed there.

   - By writing code in separate files, the codebase becomes cleaner, modular, and well-distributed.

Now, let's install some dependencies like 'env' and 'Express Mongoose.'

Moving to our `index.js`, we'll connect to the MongoDB database using Mongoose.

### For the database connection, consider the following two important points:

1. Whenever interacting with your database, it's crucial to handle potential problems. The solution is to wrap the database interactions in a try-catch block/promises provides a better approach for error handling.

2. Since databases are often located in different continents, communication takes time. To manage this delay, it's advisable to utilize asynchronous programming concepts like async-await when interacting with the database.

**Now, let's explore the first approach,**

where we consolidate all the code and functionalities for the database connection in the index.js file. Here, we utilize an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IFE) to define our function.

At times, we observe the use of listeners in Express to ensure the assurance of the database connection.

**Next, we delve into the second approach.** 

Here, we organize all the code and functionalities for the database connection in a separate folder, like the 'db' folder. We then import and execute that functionality in the index file. To implement this, navigate to the 'db' folder and create an index.js file.

In Node.js, you have access to the process, and you can utilize it without the need for importing. The key point is that the process is a reference to the current running instance.

You can manage your process using the `exit` method, allowing you to gracefully terminate your application with different exit codes.

When you connect to a database through Mongoose using the `connect` method, it provides a return object that you can store in a variable.

This returned object is a response object, indicating a successful connection to the database.

We store the returned object in a variable named `connectionInstance`. This variable holds the result of the `mongoose.connect` operation, representing the connection instance.

To extract the host information from the connection instance, you can use `connectionInstance.connection.host`.

It's crucial to consolidate practices to avoid accidentally connecting to different hosts. For example, during development and testing, the database provider may offer different hosts than the production host. This way, by checking the `connectionInstance.connection.host`, you can easily determine the current host to ensure you are connected to the intended environment.

**Now, let's proceed to the index.js file in the src folder, where we import and utilize the connection functionality.**

Here we discuss the concept of environment variable env

We know that these are environment variable we need them everywhere as our application load as early as possible 

We can import the 'env' dependency by simply using the CommonJS `require` method and configuring its path where it is available. However, this CommonJS `require` method disrupts the consistency of our preferred practice of using ES6 module import syntax.

To overcome this, we can apply an experimental feature in the package.json file so that we can use ES6 module import syntax.

For that, we go to the package.json file and navigate to where you write the "dev" script. After that, you can specify that you want to use the experimental feature by using the flag syntax "-r".

"scripts": {
    "dev": "nodemon -r dotenv/config --experimental-json-modules src/index.js"
  },


 ### `connectedDB`

"Remember that we created a `connectedDB` function asynchronously, so we use `dot then` and `catch` from where we call `connectdb`. we call it in index.js 

Keep in mind that when an asynchronous task is completed, it returns promises."

Here in the .then  part of the promise we use express event listeners for errors and also we start a server by using a listen method  

```javascript
app.on("error", () => {
  console.log("Express Error ::App DataBase Connection  :: error", error);
  throw error;
});
```

This code is setting up an event listener for errors in the Express application. Let's go through each part:

1. **`app.on("error", () => {...}`:**
   - This line is saying, "Listen for the 'error' event on the Express app." In programming, an event is like a signal that something specific has happened.

2. **`console.log("Express Error ::App DataBase Connection  :: error", error);`:**
   - When an error event occurs, this line logs a message to the console. The message includes information about the type of error, like "Express Error ::App DataBase Connection," and the details of the error.

3. **`throw error;`:**
   - This line throws an error, which means it stops the normal flow of the program and jumps to the nearest error-handling code (like a `catch` block if it's inside a `try-catch` statement).
   - Throwing an error is a way of saying, "Something unexpected happened, and we can't continue as usual."

In simple terms, this part of the code is saying, "If there's an error in the Express application, log the details of the error, and then stop everything because we can't proceed safely." It's a way to catch and handle errors in the application so that developers can be aware of issues during development or maintenance.

## Now we go to the documentation of ExpressJS we mainly focus on two things in the docs first is request and second is response 

**`req` object in Express.js:**

In Express.js, when your server receives a request (like someone visiting a webpage or making an API call), it gets a special object called `req`, which stands for "request." This object has a bunch of information about the request, and it's like a package that holds details about what the person or system is asking for.

Here are the key points:

1. **HTTP Request Information:**
   - The `req` object contains information about the request. This includes things like what URL was requested, any data that was sent along (like in a form or in the body of the request), and details about the type of request (GET, POST, etc.).

2. **Properties of the `req` Object:**
   - The `req` object has various properties that give you specific information about the request. For example:
     - `req.params`: This holds any parameters in the URL. In the example, `req.params.id` would give you the value of `id` from the URL.
     - `req.query`: This contains any parameters in the query string of the URL.
     - `req.body`: If the request includes data in the body (common in POST requests), you can access it through `req.body`.

3. **Callback Function Parameters:**
   - When you create routes in Express, you often define a function (callback) to handle what should happen when that route is accessed. In that function, you can name the `req` object whatever you like. Conventionally, it's named `req`, but you can call it anything. The important part is the information it carries.

4. **Enhanced Version of Node's Request Object:**
   - The `req` object in Express is like a supercharged version of Node.js's own request object. It has additional features and methods that make it easier to work with when building web applications.

In simpler terms, when someone asks your server for something (like a webpage or data), the server gets a special package called `req` that tells it exactly what the person wants and provides all the details needed to handle that request. Developers can then use the information in the `req` object to customize their server's response.

***

**We mainly focus on some `property of the request object`  in like a request.params, request.body, request.cookies**

**Let's break down the concept of `req.params property of the request object`  in Express.js in easy language:**

In Express.js, when your server receives a request, it often includes information in the URL. The `req.params` is like a special box that holds these pieces of information, specifically the parts of the URL that are defined as parameters.

Here are the key points:

1. **URL Parameters:**
   - When you define a route with parameters in Express, like `/user/:name`, it means that someone can visit a URL like `/user/tj`. The `req.params` object holds these values.

2. **Properties in `req.params`:**
   - If you have a route like `/user/:name`, then `req.params.name` will give you the value of the `name` parameter. In the example, if someone visits `/user/tj`, `req.params.name` will be "tj".

3. **Regular Expressions and Capture Groups:**
   - If you use a regular expression in your route definition or have wildcard matches, like `/file/*`, the captured values are available in the `req.params` array. For example, if someone requests `/file/javascripts/jquery.js`, `req.params[0]` will be "javascripts/jquery.js".

4. **Changing `req.params`:**
   - If you need to make changes to a key in `req.params`, you can use the `app.param` handler. However, these changes only affect parameters already defined in the route path.

5. **Automatic Decoding:**
   - Express automatically decodes the values in `req.params`. This means that if values are URL-encoded (e.g., spaces represented as `%20`), Express decodes them to their original form.

6. **Middleware and Route Handler Reset:**
   - Any changes made to the `req.params` object in a middleware or route handler will be reset after the request is processed. It's like a temporary space used during the handling of a specific request.

In simpler terms, `req.params` is like a box that holds pieces of information from the URL. It's useful when you want to capture specific values (parameters) from the URL and use them in your server logic.

***

**Let's break down the concept of `req.body property of req object` in Express.js and body-parsing middleware in easy language:**

In Express.js, when someone sends data to your server (for example, when submitting a form on a website), that data is often included in the request body. The `req.body` is like a container that holds all the key-value pairs of this submitted data.

Here are the key points:

1. **Submitted Data:**
   - When someone interacts with your website or application, they might submit data, like filling out a form or sending information. This data is sent in the request body.

2. **`req.body` in Express:**
   - The `req.body` object in Express holds all the data submitted in the request body. It's like a bag that keeps all the information neatly organized.

3. **Default Value and Middleware:**
   - By default, when a request arrives, `req.body` is undefined. To populate it with the submitted data, you need to use body-parsing middleware. Middleware is like a set of tools that help process incoming requests.

4. **Validation is Important:**
   - Since the data in `req.body` comes from users who can manipulate it, it's essential to validate it before trusting or using it in your application. Validation ensures that the data is in the expected format and prevents potential issues.

5. **Example Using Middleware:**
   - The provided example shows how to use two popular body-parsing middleware packages: `body-parser` and `multer`. These packages help parse different types of data, such as JSON and form-urlencoded data.

   - In the example:
     - `bodyParser.json()` is for parsing JSON data.
     - `bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true })` is for parsing form-urlencoded data.
     - `multer()` is for parsing multipart/form-data, often used for file uploads.

   - The `app.post('/profile', upload.array(), ...)` route is an example where data is posted to the server, and `console.log(req.body)` prints the submitted data to the console.

In simpler terms, `req.body` is like a container that holds all the information someone sends to your server. To use this data effectively, you need to use middleware tools like `body-parser` and `multer`. Always validate the data in `req.body` to ensure it's safe and in the expected format.

***

**Let's break down the concept of `req.cookies property of req object` in Express.js with the help of the `cookie-parser` middleware:**

When someone visits a website, the server can send back small pieces of data to be stored on the visitor's browser. These are called cookies, and they help the server remember information about the user. The `req.cookies` in Express.js is like a container that holds these cookies when the server receives a request.

Here are the key points:

1. **Cookies and `cookie-parser`:**
   - Cookies are tiny pieces of data sent by a website and stored on the user's browser. They can contain information like user preferences or session details.
   - To work with cookies in Express, developers often use a middleware called `cookie-parser`.

2. **`req.cookies` Object:**
   - When the `cookie-parser` middleware is used, the `req.cookies` object is created. It's like a collection that stores all the cookies sent by the user's browser.

3. **Accessing Cookie Values:**
   - You can access specific cookie values using the cookie's name as a property of `req.cookies`. For example:
     ```javascript
     // If the request includes a cookie named 'name'
     console.dir(req.cookies.name); // Outputs the value of the 'name' cookie
     ```

4. **Handling Signed Cookies:**
   - If cookies are signed for additional security, you should use `req.signedCookies` instead of `req.cookies`. Signed cookies are cookies that have been encrypted, and they are verified by the server.

5. **Example:**
   - If a user sends a request with a cookie like `Cookie: name=tj`, `req.cookies.name` will give you the value "tj".

In simpler terms, `req.cookies` is like a bag that holds all the cookies a user sent with their request. These cookies can contain information that helps the server remember things about the user. Using `cookie-parser` middleware makes it easy to work with these cookies in your Express.js application.

**Configuring in Express**

Configuring in Express refers to setting up or adjusting various settings and options for your Express application. It involves providing specific instructions to customize the behavior and functionality of your server.

In simpler terms, when you configure your Express application, you are telling it how to handle certain aspects, such as:

1. **Middleware:** You configure which middleware functions should be used and in what order. Middleware functions can handle tasks like logging, data parsing, authentication, etc.

2. **Routes:** You set up routes to define how your application responds to different types of requests. Each route is configured to handle specific HTTP methods and paths.

3. **Settings:** You can configure various settings for your application, such as the view engine, static file directories, and more.

4. **Environment:** Express allows you to configure your application differently based on the environment it's running in (development, production, testing).

Configuring in Express is about tailoring your application to behave the way you want it to, based on your specific requirements and preferences. It provides a flexible and customizable framework to build web applications.

**parsing in Express**

In the context of Express, parsing usually refers to the process of extracting and interpreting data from incoming requests. When a client sends data to your server, it's often in the form of a request, and this data needs to be understood by your server.

For example, when you submit a form on a website, the data from that form (like the information you typed into text fields) needs to be "parsed" by Express. Express uses middleware (like `body-parser` or the built-in `express.json()` middleware) to parse this incoming data and make it accessible to your server-side code.

So, parsing in Express is like unwrapping the data sent from a client so that your server can understand and work with it easily.


***

**middleware in Express**

In Express, middleware is like a set of tools or functions that help process and manage incoming requests and outgoing responses. Imagine a request is like a package traveling through a series of stops (middlewares) before reaching its final destination (your application's route handler).

Middleware functions have access to the request object (`req`), the response object (`res`), and the `next` function in the application’s request-response cycle. They can perform tasks such as modifying the request or response, ending the request-response cycle, and calling the next middleware in the stack.

Here's a simple analogy: think of your Express application as a highway for requests. Middleware acts like toll booths along the highway. Each toll booth can inspect, modify, or even block the incoming cars (requests) before allowing them to proceed further down the highway.

Common uses for middleware include handling data parsing, logging, authentication, and more. They enhance the functionality and structure of your Express application by breaking down tasks into manageable and reusable components.

***

**various properties and methods in Express for configuration**

In Express, configuration is often done through various properties and methods. Some commonly used properties for configuring an Express application include:

1. **`app.set(name, value)`**: This method is used to set application-level settings. For example:
   ```javascript
   app.set('view engine', 'ejs');
   ```

2. **`app.use([path,] callback [, callback...])`**: The `app.use()` method is used to mount middleware functions. Middleware functions are a way to configure how your application handles requests. For example:
   ```javascript
   app.use(express.json());
   ```
   app.use(): This is a method in Express that is used to set up middleware functions. Middleware functions are like helpers that can perform tasks when a request comes in.

3. **`app.locals`**: An object that can be used to store variables that are local to the application. These variables can be accessed within templates or route handlers.

4. **`app.engine`**: Configures the template engine for rendering views. For example:
   ```javascript
   app.engine('html', require('ejs').renderFile);
   ```

5. **`app.set('env', 'development')`**: Sets the environment mode for your application. The environment can be 'development', 'production', or 'testing', and certain configurations may vary based on the environment.

These are just a few examples, and the choice of properties/methods depends on what aspect of the application you are configuring (e.g., middleware, views, environment, etc.). The official Express documentation is a great resource for understanding all available options for configuration: [Express Application settings](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html#app.settings).

***

## Now we install and discuss on some packages like cookie parser and CORS:

_We use , app.use(): This is a method in Express that is used to set up middleware functions. Middleware functions are like helpers that can perform tasks when a request comes in._

"We import CORS and Cookie Parser in the `app.js` file. Now, let's review the CORS configuration. Additionally, we'll examine some settings before the cookie options."

Certainly! Let's break down the provided code in easy language:

```javascript
app.use(
  cors({
    origin: process.env.CORS_ORIGIN,
    credentials: true,
  })
);
```

This code is configuring Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for an Express.js application. Let's understand what each part does:

1. **`app.use(cors({ origin: process.env.CORS_ORIGIN, credentials: true }))`:**
   - This line tells Express to use the `cors` middleware for all routes in the application.
   - `cors` is a middleware that helps in handling CORS-related issues, allowing or restricting access to resources on your server from different origins (websites).
  
2. **`origin: process.env.CORS_ORIGIN`:**
   - The `origin` option in `cors` determines which origins (websites) are allowed to access the resources on your server.
   - `process.env.CORS_ORIGIN` refers to an environment variable that should contain the allowed origin. This allows you to dynamically set the allowed origin based on your environment.

3. **`credentials: true`:**
   - The `credentials` option is set to `true`. This means that the server allows the browser to include credentials (like cookies or HTTP authentication) in the cross-origin request.
   - It's essential when your application involves authentication or when you want to send and receive cookies across different domains.

In simple terms, this configuration is saying:
- Allow requests from the origin specified in the `CORS_ORIGIN` environment variable.
- Allow credentials to be included in cross-origin requests.

By using this setup, the Express application is ready to handle cross-origin requests in a secure and controlled manner, ensuring that only specified origins are allowed, and credentials can be included when necessary.

***

If you set `CORS_ORIGIN` to `"*"` (wildcard) in your environment variable, it means that you are allowing any origin to make cross-origin requests to your server. Let's break down the implications:

```javascript
app.use(
  cors({
    origin: process.env.CORS_ORIGIN,
    credentials: true,
  })
);
```

1. **`origin: process.env.CORS_ORIGIN`:**
   - In this case, `process.env.CORS_ORIGIN` would be set to `"*"` (wildcard), meaning any origin is allowed to access your server's resources.

2. **`credentials: true`:**
   - Despite using a wildcard for the origin, you have set `credentials` to `true`, which means the server allows the inclusion of credentials (like cookies or HTTP authentication) in the cross-origin request.

Implications:
- **Any Origin Allowed:** Allowing any origin (`"*"`) can be a security risk, as it opens up your server to potential abuse from any website. This is generally not recommended unless you have a specific reason for it.

- **Credentials Allowed:** Allowing credentials with a wildcard origin might introduce security vulnerabilities, as it permits any website to send and receive sensitive information like cookies. Be cautious with this setting, especially if your application involves authentication.

- **CORS Security:** Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a security feature implemented by web browsers to restrict web pages from making requests to a different domain than the one that served the web page. While using a wildcard allows any origin, it might not adhere to the best security practices.

In summary, using `CORS_ORIGIN = "*"` allows any website to access your server's resources, and it's important to carefully consider the security implications, especially if your application involves sensitive data or authentication. It's usually recommended to specify specific origins rather than using a wildcard, whenever possible.

***
**"We know that in our backend, data comes from various sources such as URLs, JSON requests, and bodies like form submissions. Here, we'll discuss some good practices to handle all these situations."**


**Now we do some configuration and set up middlewares**


***When we get data in JSON format***

Certainly! In easy language, `app.use(express.json({limit: "16kb"}))` in Express is like setting a rule for your server to handle incoming data.

- **`express.json()`**: This is a middleware in Express that helps your server understand and work with data that comes in JSON format. For example, when someone submits a form on a website, the data is often sent in JSON format.

- **`{limit: "16kb"}`**: This part is setting a limit on how big that JSON data can be. In this case, it's saying, "Hey, if someone sends JSON data to my server, make sure it's not larger than 16 kilobytes (16kb)."

So, this line is essentially saying, "Use the middleware to handle JSON data, but don't accept JSON data larger than 16kb." It's a way to control the size of the data your server is willing to accept in a JSON format.


***
***When we get data through URL***

Sure, let's break down `app.use(express.urlencoded({extended: true, limit: "16kb"}))` in easy language:

- **`express.urlencoded()`**: This is another middleware in Express. It helps your server handle data when it comes from HTML forms. When you submit a form on a website, the data is usually sent as URL-encoded data.

- **`{extended: true, limit: "16kb"}`**: Here, you are setting some options for how the server should handle this URL-encoded data.
  - `extended: true`: This option allows for parsing complex objects in the URL-encoded data.
  - `limit: "16kb"`: Similar to the previous explanation, it sets a limit on the size of the data to 16 kilobytes (16kb).

So, this line is saying, "Use the middleware to handle data from HTML forms, and allow for parsing complex objects in the form data. Also, don't accept form data larger than 16kb." It's a way to control how your server processes and limits the size of form data from incoming requests.

***
***When we send static file to server ***


Absolutely, let's break down `app.use(express.static("public"))` in easy language:

- **`express.static("public")`**: This is a middleware in Express that helps serve static files, like HTML, CSS, images, or JavaScript, directly to the client without any special handling.

- **`"public"`**: This part specifies the folder name where your static files are stored. In this case, it's saying, "Hey, all the static files are in a folder named 'public'."

- **`app.use()`**: This is how you tell your Express application to use this middleware. It's like saying, "Whenever there's a request for a static file, check the 'public' folder and send it to the client."

So, this line is essentially saying, "Use the middleware to serve static files from the 'public' folder to anyone who requests them." It's a convenient way to make your static files accessible to users when they visit your website.

***

**app.use(cookieParser())**

Certainly! Let's break down `app.use(cookieParser())` in easy language:

- **`cookieParser()`**: This is a middleware in Express that helps your server deal with cookies. Cookies are small pieces of data that a website can send to a user's browser, and the browser stores this data for future requests.

- **`app.use()`**: This is how you tell your Express application to use the cookie parser middleware. It's like saying, "Whenever there's a request, check if there are any cookies, and if there are, make them easy to work with."

So, this line is essentially saying, "Use the cookie parser middleware to handle and parse any cookies that come with the requests." It makes dealing with cookies in your Express application much simpler.



## Now we learn the concept of middleware's:

1. Previously, you wrote a code with `app.get()` where inside, a callback function was explained. This function details how to send a response when someone visits the server.

2. Understanding this concept is crucial because it forms the foundation for learning about middleware.

3. When a client hits a specific URL, like `/moaz`, your server is instructed to send a response using `app.send()`.

4. However, it's not as straightforward as just sending a response. There is some processing involved. You don't want everyone who visits your URL to get a response. Therefore, checks are implemented.

5. These checks are known as `middlewares`. They act as intermediaries between the incoming request and the server's response. 

6. In the case of your example, the middleware checks if the requester is authenticated. If they are, the server proceeds with sending the response; otherwise, access may be denied.

_The next in the img2 to is related to middleware next is only a flag when the work of first middleware is completed then it pass the flags to next mideliver and last is send response._

## Now we set up some of our utilities that help us to create a clean codeflow:

"We consistently interact with the database in various controllers, such as the user controller or video controller. Writing database connection and configuration code each time can be repetitive. To address this, we create a utility file to house a generalized function. This function allows anyone wanting to communicate with the database to pass their specific function to our utility. The generalized function then executes the database configuration code and functions, returning the result.

This practice is common in the industry. You can create this utility inside a 'service' folder, and you're free to name it as you prefer.

In our example, we've created an `asynchandler.js` file in the 'utils' folder to house this utility. The utility accommodates both promise and async/await methods, as database connections can take time. We cover both methods to cater to different preferences in the development process."

***

**1st async/await method**

Certainly! Let's break down the `asyncHandler` function in easy language:

```javascript
const asyncHandler = (fn) => async (req, res, next) => {
  try {
    await fn(req, res, next);
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(err.code || 500).json({
      success: false,
      message: err.message
    });
  }
};
```

1. **`const asyncHandler = (fn) => async (req, res, next) => { ... }`**:
   - This creates a function called `asyncHandler`.
   - It takes another function (`fn`) as an argument.
   - It returns a new function that accepts `req`, `res`, and `next` parameters.

2. **`try { await fn(req, res, next); }`**:
   - Inside this function, it tries to execute the provided function (`fn`) with `await`.
   - The `await` keyword is used with asynchronous functions to wait for them to complete before moving on.

3. **`catch (error) { ... }`**:
   - If there's an error during the execution of the function, it catches the error.
   - It then sends a JSON response with an appropriate status code (taken from the error's `code` property or defaulting to 500) and a message indicating the failure.

So, in simpler terms, `asyncHandler` is a utility function that helps handle asynchronous functions used in Express middleware. It wraps the provided function, catches any errors that occur during its execution, and sends a meaningful JSON response if there's an error. This helps to centralize error handling for asynchronous operations in your Express application.


***
**res.status(code)**

1. **HTTP Status:**
   - When your server responds to a request, it includes an HTTP status code in the response. This code indicates the outcome of the request—whether it was successful, encountered an error, or needs further action.
  
2. **`res.status(code)`:**
   - In Express.js (a web application framework for Node.js), when you handle a request, you use the `res` (response) object to send a response back to the client.
   - The `res.status(code)` method is used to set the HTTP status code for that response.

3. **Chainable Alias:**
   - The term "chainable" means you can chain this method with other methods.
   - For example, you might want to set the status code and send a message in the same line of code.
   - Chaining allows you to perform multiple operations on the response object in a single statement.

4. **Node’s Alias:**
   - It's mentioned as an "alias of Node’s" because Express.js is built on top of Node.js, and it often exposes methods that have aliases or similar functionalities from the underlying Node.js core.

In simple terms:
- `res.status(code)` is a way to tell the client about the outcome of their request.
- You can chain it with other methods to streamline your code.
- It's similar to how Node.js itself handles HTTP responses, and Express.js provides a convenient way to work with it.

***

Certainly! Let's break down `res.status(err.code || 500).json({ success: false, message: err.message });` in easy language:

1. **`res.status(err.code || 500)`**:
   - This part sets the HTTP status code for the response.
   - It uses `err.code` if it exists, otherwise defaults to 500 (Internal Server Error).
   - It's like saying, "Set the HTTP status code based on the error code, or use 500 if there is no specific error code."

2. **`.json({ success: false, message: err.message })`**:
   - This part sends a JSON response with two properties: `success` and `message`.
   - `success: false` indicates that the operation was not successful.
   - `message: err.message` provides a descriptive message about the error.

So, in simpler terms, this line of code is creating a response that communicates whether an operation was successful or not. If there's an error, it sets an appropriate HTTP status code and sends a JSON response with details about the error, including a descriptive message.

***

**2nd promise method**

Certainly! Let's break down the `asyncHandler` function in easy language:

```javascript
const asyncHandler = (requestHandler) => {
  (req, res, next) => {
    Promise.resolve(requestHandler(req, res, next))
      .catch((err) => next(err));
  }
};
```

1. **`const asyncHandler = (requestHandler) => { ... }`**:
   - This creates a function called `asyncHandler`.
   - It takes another function (`requestHandler`) as an argument.

2. **`(req, res, next) => { ... }`**:
   - This is an anonymous function that takes three parameters: `req` (request), `res` (response), and `next` (a function to pass control to the next middleware/route).

3. **`Promise.resolve(requestHandler(req, res, next))`**:
   - It takes the result of calling `requestHandler(req, res, next)` and wraps it in a resolved Promise.
   - This is useful for handling asynchronous operations.

4. **`.catch((err) => next(err))`**:
   - If there's an error during the execution of `requestHandler`, the `catch` block is triggered.
   - It calls `next(err)`, which passes the error to the next middleware or route in the sequence.

So, in simpler terms, `asyncHandler` is a utility function that wraps around another function (`requestHandler`). It ensures that any errors that occur during the execution of `requestHandler` are caught and passed to the next middleware or route. This is especially useful when dealing with asynchronous code.

## Now we discuss one more topics about structuring the custom api error and response 

**Structure the api error**

1. **Dealing with Database Connection and Requests:**
   - When we work with databases or handle various scenarios on the server, things might not always go as planned. There can be errors, unexpected situations, or issues that need attention.

2. **Handling Errors:**
   - To handle errors effectively, it's a good practice to structure error responses in a consistent way. This means defining how errors are formatted and communicated back to the client.

3. **Structured Error in One File:**
   - Instead of scattering error handling code throughout our project, it's more organized to centralize error structures in one file. This file contains classes or functions that help us create standardized error responses.

4. **Node.js API Errors:**
   - Node.js provides a set of built-in classes and methods for handling errors. This is known as the Node.js API for errors.

5. **Separate Classes:**
   - In your project, you create separate classes for different types of errors. These classes extend the built-in Node.js error classes.

6. **Overwriting Methods:**
   - By extending the Node.js error classes, you can customize and overwrite specific methods. This allows you to add additional information or modify the behavior of these errors to suit your application.

In simpler terms:
- When things go wrong in our server (like with databases), we need to communicate errors to clients in a structured way.
- To do this, we create a centralized file that defines how errors are formatted.
- Node.js has built-in error handling tools that we can extend and customize to fit our needs.
- We create separate classes for different types of errors and tweak them as necessary.
- This approach helps keep error handling organized and consistent throughout our code.




Certainly! Let's break down the concept of the `Error` class in easy language:

In JavaScript, an `Error` is like a special object that represents something going wrong in your code. It helps you identify and handle problems that might occur while your program is running. Here are the key points:

1. **What is the `Error` Class?**
   - The `Error` class is a fundamental part of JavaScript that helps you deal with errors in your code. When something unexpected happens, you can use an `Error` object to capture information about what went wrong.

2. **Creating an `Error` Object:**
   - You can create a new `Error` object using the `new Error()` syntax. When you create it, you can provide a message that describes the error. For example, you might say "Hey, something went wrong!"

   ```javascript
   const myError = new Error("Hey, something went wrong!");
   ```

3. **Capturing a "Stack Trace":**
   - An `Error` object not only stores the error message but also captures a "stack trace." This is like a record of where in your code the error occurred. It helps you trace back the steps that led to the error.

4. **Options:**
   - You can also provide additional information when creating an `Error` object. For instance, you might specify a "cause," which is another error or reason that led to the current error.

   ```javascript
   const myError = new Error("Something went wrong!", { cause: anotherError });
   ```

5. **Handling Different Errors:**
   - Whether it's a mistake in your code or an issue with the system, errors in JavaScript are usually represented as instances of the `Error` class or its subclasses. This makes it easier for developers to identify and respond to different types of errors.

In simpler terms, an `Error` in JavaScript is like a little assistant that helps you understand and deal with problems in your code. It tells you what happened, where it happened, and sometimes even why it happened, making it easier for you to fix issues and improve your code.


Certainly! Let's break down the code for the `ApiError` class in easy language:

```javascript
class ApiError extends Error {
  constructor(
    statusCode,
    message = "Something went wrong",
    errors = [],
    stack = ""
  ) {
    super(message);
    this.statusCode = statusCode;
    this.data = null;
    this.message = message;
    this.success = false;
    this.errors = errors;

    if (stack) {
      this.stack = stack;
    } else {
      Error.captureStackTrace(this, this.constructor);
    }
  }
}

export { ApiError };
```

1. **`class ApiError extends Error { ... }`**:
   - This declares a new class named `ApiError` that extends the built-in `Error` class in JavaScript. It means `ApiError` inherits properties and methods from the `Error` class.

2. **`constructor(statusCode, message = "Something went wrong", errors = [], stack = "") { ... }`**:
   - This is the constructor method that gets called when a new `ApiError` object is created.
   - It takes four parameters: `statusCode` (HTTP status code), `message` (error message, default is "Something went wrong"), `errors` (an array of additional error details), and `stack` (stack trace).

3. **`super(message);`**:
   - Calls the constructor of the parent class (`Error` in this case) with the provided `message`. It sets up the error message.

4. **Property Assignments**:
   - `this.statusCode = statusCode;`: Assigns the provided HTTP status code to the `statusCode` property.
   - `this.data = null;`: Initializes `data` property with `null`.
   - `this.message = message;`: Assigns the provided error message to the `message` property.
   - `this.success = false;`: Initializes `success` property with `false`.
   - `this.errors = errors;`: Assigns the provided array of errors to the `errors` property.

5. **`if (stack) { ... } else { ... }`**:
   - Checks if a stack trace is provided (`stack` is truthy). If provided, it assigns it to the `stack` property. Otherwise, it captures a stack trace using `Error.captureStackTrace`.

6. **`export { ApiError };`**:
   - Exports the `ApiError` class to make it available for use in other modules.

In simple terms, this code defines a custom `ApiError` class that extends the standard `Error` class. It's designed to create instances representing errors that might occur in an API. The class allows you to specify the HTTP status code, a custom error message, additional error details, and a stack trace.


**Structure the api response**

"We can also create a response file for structuring our API responses. However, in this case, we cannot utilize the Node.js response class because we are handling responses within the Express framework. Express doesn't provide classes like Node.js does.

In this scenario, we are not extending any classes; instead, we are creating a new class to structure our API responses."


Certainly! Let's break down the provided code in easy language:

```javascript
class ApiResponse {
    constructor(statusCode, data, message = "Success") {
        this.statusCode = statusCode;
        this.data = data;
        this.message = message;
        this.success = statusCode < 400;
    }
}

export { ApiResponse };
```

This code defines a JavaScript class called `ApiResponse`. This class is like a blueprint for creating objects that represent responses from a server or an API (Application Programming Interface).

Here's a breakdown of what this class does:

1. **Constructor:**
   - The class has a constructor, which is a special method that gets called when you create a new object from this class. It takes three parameters: `statusCode`, `data`, and an optional `message`.

2. **Properties:**
   - Inside the constructor, it sets four properties on the object being created:
      - `statusCode`: This property holds a numerical value representing the HTTP status code of the response. For example, 200 for success or 404 for not found.
      - `data`: This property holds the actual data that the server wants to send back as a response. It could be a JSON object, a string, or any other type of data.
      - `message`: This property holds a text message describing the response. By default, it's set to "Success," but you can provide a custom message.
      - `success`: This property is a boolean (true/false) that indicates whether the response was successful. It's determined by checking if the `statusCode` is less than 400 (HTTP status codes less than 400 generally indicate success).

3. **Exporting the Class:**
   - The `export { ApiResponse };` statement at the end allows other parts of the code to use this `ApiResponse` class. It makes the class available for import in other files or modules.

In simple terms, this class helps in creating consistent and structured responses when building web applications. It bundles together the HTTP status code, data, and a message into a neat package, making it easier to handle and understand the results of requests made to a server or API. The `success` property is a convenient way to quickly check if the response was successful.


***

Certainly! Let's break down HTTP response status codes in easy language:

When you make a request to a website (like opening a webpage or submitting a form), the server responds with a status code. This status code is like a short message that tells your browser or application what happened with the request. Here are the main categories of status codes:

1. **Informational responses (100 – 199):**
   - These are like messages that provide information about the request but don't necessarily indicate success or failure. For example, a server might say, "I received your request, and I'm working on it."

2. **Successful responses (200 – 299):**
   - This is the good news category! These status codes mean that your request was successful. For instance, if you open a webpage, and the server responds with a 200 status code, it's saying, "Here's the content you asked for, and everything went well."

3. **Redirection messages (300 – 399):**
   - Sometimes, the server needs to tell your browser to go somewhere else to get what you asked for. Redirection codes guide your browser to the correct location. For example, if a webpage has moved, the server might say, "Go to this new address to find what you're looking for."

4. **Client error responses (400 – 499):**
   - Uh-oh! These codes indicate that there was a problem with the request you made. It's usually something on your end. For instance, if you try to access a page that doesn't exist, the server might say, "I couldn't find what you're looking for."

5. **Server error responses (500 – 599):**
   - This is when the server itself encounters a problem fulfilling your request. It's not your fault; it's something on the server's side. The server might say, "Oops, I made a mistake, and I couldn't process your request."

In summary, HTTP status codes are like quick messages from the server to your browser or application, letting them know how a request went. Successful ones tell you everything is fine, while others provide information about issues or changes. It's a way for computers to communicate about the success or failure of requests on the internet.
